# ILBFS vs RBFS 

## Overview

This project presents the first-ever implementation of Iterative Linear Best-First Search (ILBFS) alongside Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS). Our goal is to compare these algorithms in terms of memory usage and efficiency, focusing on their application to the 8-tile problem.

## Purpose

The primary aim of this project is to explore the capabilities of ILBFS as a more intuitive and pedagogically beneficial alternative to RBFS. While both algorithms solve best-first search problems with linear memory and maintain the same node expansion order, ILBFS offers a clearer approach, making it valuable for educational purposes.

## Features

- **ILBFS Implementation**: The first implementation of this algorithm, designed to be straightforward and easy to understand.
- **Comparison with RBFS**: Evaluating memory usage, runtime, and efficiency.
- **8-Tile Problem**: Testing the algorithms on random problem instances with varying solution lengths.

## Conclusion

ILBFS, despite being slightly slower than RBFS, provides significant educational benefits due to its simplicity and clear structure, making it an excellent tool for learning best-first search concepts.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different parameters to gain a deeper understanding of both algorithms!
